1) why doesn't res.redirect() work?
A) try re-rendering the index page - didn't work
- solved this issue temporarily with timers.


2) why are all notes pushing to different articles?
A)fixed!
This was being caused because the string of the _id didn't have a key and
wasn't being treated like an object. 

work left:
1) add delete functionality to notes
2) styling
